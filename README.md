## Pixie 328

This is a very bare minimum breadboard Arduino board. 

It uses a standard FTDI connector on one end to program the ATtiny85 Micro controller with, and has a ICSP header to burn the boot loader on the other end. 

It also has a place for a ceramic frequency clock, and an optional reset pullup resistor. 

The pull-up resistor is optional, as the internal pull-up will work, unless you expressly turn it off. 

Bare minimum, and inspired by Dale Wheat's breadboard Arduino.
